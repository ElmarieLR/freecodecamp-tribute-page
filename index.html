        <p>Nobody knows exactly where the Cheshire Cat comes from. Lewis Carroll immortalised this cat in his 1865 novel ‘Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland’, but this is not the first we hear about this toothy feline.</p>
		<p>The first time we read about this magical beast was in a dictionary from 1788. In Grappenhall stands a church with a carving of a cat, which might be the Cheshire Cat, dating from the 16th century.</p>
		<p>Little was known about the Cheshire Cat. We only know that, like any other domesticated felines, he can disappear and appear at will. What makes the Cheshire Cat stand out from other cats, is his ability to let parts of his body disappear. A great example of this is the famous scene where he makes most of his body disappear leaving only his grin.</p>
		<p>It is believed that he is a stout tabby cat. Some people thought him rude or silly, while others (me included) found him truly insightful.</p>
		<p>There is no evidence that this captivating creature ever left this world. Who knows, maybe he'll appear again.</p>
